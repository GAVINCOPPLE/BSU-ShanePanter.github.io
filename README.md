Welcome to my GitHub page.

I’m currently studying Computer Science at Boise State University with an emphasis in Cybersecurity. This page is a simple place to showcase some of the projects and coursework I’ve worked on throughout the program.

## About Me

I’m interested in cybersecurity, IT operations, and building practical skills that translate into real-world problem solving. A lot of my coursework includes Java programming, discrete mathematics, version control, and web development.

## Projects & Coursework

Some of the work I’ve completed includes:

- Java GUI applications (CS121)
- Discrete Math problem solving
- Git and version control labs
- Basic HTML/CSS portfolio work

More projects will continue to be added as I progress through the program.
